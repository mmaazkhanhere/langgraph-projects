              "'Based on the debate history, I conclude that Joe Biden presented more logical and stronger arguments than Donald Trump. Here\\'s my reasoning:\\n\\n**Logical Consistency:** Biden\\'s argumentation follows a clear and consistent line of reasoning. He emphasizes the importance of defending sovereignty and international law, while also acknowledging the need for caution in getting involved in foreign conflicts. Trump\\'s argument, on the other hand, is inconsistent in that he criticizes Biden\\'s approach as an \"empty promise\" while proposing a vague and simplistic plan for conflict resolution.\\n\\n**Evidence and Support:** Biden provides more evidence and support for his claims. For example, he points out that the US is not escalating the conflict in Ukraine, but rather defending Ukraine\\'s sovereignty. He also highlights the difference between the Ukraine conflict and previous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where US troops were sent to the ground. Trump, on the other hand, relies on general criticisms of Biden\\'s past record without providing concrete evidence or specific examples.\\n\\n**Rebuttals and Counterarguments:** Biden effectively addresses Trump\\'s arguments by criticizing his simplistic approach to conflict resolution and pointing out the lack of concrete steps in his plan. Trump\\'s rebuttals, on the other hand, are largely based on personal attacks and criticisms of Biden\\'s past record, rather than addressing the substance of his arguments.\\n\\n**Clarity and Persuasiveness:** Biden\\'s communication is clear, concise, and persuasive. He effectively conveys his points to the audience and highlights the complexities of conflict resolution. Trump\\'s communication, on the other hand, is often vague and simplistic, relying on general statements and personal attacks.\\n\\n**Overall Impact:** Biden\\'s arguments have a greater overall impact and persuade me more effectively. He presents a nuanced and thoughtful approach to conflict resolution, acknowledging the complexities of the issue while also emphasizing the importance of defending sovereignty and international law. Trump\\'s arguments, on the other hand, are largely based on simplistic and vague proposals that lack concrete evidence and support.\\n\\nIn summary, I chose Joe Biden as the winner because he presents a more logical and consistent argumentation, provides more evidence and support for his claims, effectively addresses Trump\\'s arguments, and communicates his points clearly and persuasively.'"

Biden, a member of the Democratic Party who previously served as vice president for two terms under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, took office after his victory in the 2020 presidential election over the incumbent president, Donald Trump of the Republican Party. Upon his inauguration, he became the oldest president in American history, breaking the record set by Ronald Reagan. Biden entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic crisis, and increased political polarization. He withdrew his bid for a second term in the 2024 presidential election due to low popularity and concerns over his age and health. He is to be succeeded by Trump in January 2025, who won the aforementioned election.\\nDay one actions of his presidency included restoring U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement, revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and halting funding for Trump\\'s border wall. On his second day, he issued a series of executive orders to reduce the impact of COVID-19, including invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, and set an early goal of achieving one hundred million COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in his first 100 days. The first major legislation signed into law by Biden was the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that temporarily established expanded unemployment insurance and sent $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans in response to continued economic pressure from COVID-19. He signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a ten-year plan brokered by Biden alongside Democrats and Republicans in Congress to invest in American roads, bridges, public transit, ports and broadband access.\\nBiden proposed a significant expansion of the U.S. social safety net through the Build Back Better Act, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. In August 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a domestic appropriations bill that included some of the provisions of the Build Back Better Act after the entire bill failed to pass. It included significant federal investment in climate and domestic clean energy production, tax credits for solar panels, electric cars and other home energy programs as well as a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, an insulin price cap, and a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. In late 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and codified same-sex and interracial marriage in the United States. Other domestic legislation signed during his term included the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first major federal gun control law in nearly three decades; the CHIPS and Science Act, bolstering the semiconductor and manufacturing industry; the Honoring our PACT Act, expanding health care for US veterans; the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act; and the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, making Juneteenth a federal holiday in the United States. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court—the first Black woman to serve on the court. In response to the debt-ceiling crisis of 2023, Biden negotiated and signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which restrains federal spending for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, implements minor changes to SNAP and TANF, includes energy permitting reform, claws back some IRS funding and unspent money for COVID-19, and suspends the debt ceiling to January 1, 2025. He established the American Climate Corps and created the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. On September 26, 2023, Biden visited a United Auto Workers picket line during the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, making him the first US president to visit one.\\nThe foreign policy goal of the Biden administration is to restore the US to a \"position of trusted leadership\" among global democracies in order to address the challenges posed by Russia and China. Biden signed AUKUS, an international security alliance together with Australia and the United Kingdom. He supported the expansion of NATO with the additions of Finland and Sweden. Biden approved a raid which led to the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the leader of the Islamic State, and approved a drone strike which killed Ayman Al Zawahiri, leader of Al-Qaeda. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, declaring an end to nation-building efforts and shifting U.S. foreign policy toward strategic competition with China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. However, during the withdrawal, the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control, leading to Biden receiving bipartisan criticism. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia as well as providing Ukraine with over $100 billion in combined military, economic, and humanitarian aid. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism and announced American military support for Israel; he also sent humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and brokered a four-day temporary pause and hostage exchange. Biden negotiated and oversaw the 2024 Ankara prisoner exchange, the largest prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War, involving the release of twenty-six individuals, including American journalist Evan Gershkovich and former United States Marine Paul Whelan.\\nBiden began his term with over 50% approval ratings; however, these fell significantly after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and remained low as the country experienced high inflation and rising gas prices, even as they would eventually reduce over his presidency. His age and mental fitness remained a frequent subject of discussion throughout his presidency, ultimately culminating in his late decision to not seek re-election. Despite this, Biden oversaw the strongest economic recovery of any G7 nation post COVID-19 and one of the strongest economic recoveries in United States history, breaking a 70-year record for low unemployment, and the creation of over 16 million new jobs, the most of any single term president.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden'}, page_content='Joe Biden\\'s tenure as the 46th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 2021.

From June 2024, it allowed Ukraine to strike inside Russia with US-supplied weapons, but only near the border in self-defense.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nAs it has been reported, the Biden administration got information on a potential Russian invasion as early as March 2021, at the time of large Russian military exercises. The US attempted to deter Russia from invading, among other, by proposing US - Russia summit, and meeting with Russian officials in November 2021 and January 2022. The efforts failed.\\n\\n\\n== Strategy ==\\nSince the start of the Russian invasion in 2022, US President Joe Biden has articulated a cautious US strategy towards the war. The goals were to mitigate the risk of escalation into a direct US-Russia confrontation while hindering Russia\\'s military success. Biden administration emphasized sustained support \"for as long as it takes\" to assist Ukraine\\'s defense efforts. However, these are coupled with a focus on avoiding actions that could be construed as provocative by Russia and potentially leading to a wider war.\\nThis cautious approach prioritizes limiting US risks of getting militarily involved while leaving the primary burden of repelling the invasion on Ukraine. Political scientist Kori Schake characterizes this strategy as exhibiting a \"vulnerability of US support\", arguing that the self-imposed limitations on US assistance, compared to Russia\\'s aggression not limited by any boundaries, create a significant strategic advantage for Russia.\\nWhile this US strategy has been static for 2 years of war, the situation on the battlefield was changing with time. Eventually, static US strategy encountered its limitations. As the war enters its third year (as of April 2024), the battlefield situation evolved towards a stalemate and towards increased concerns that a persistent and determined Russian offensive could ultimately achieve its objectives.\\n\\n\\n== Aid to Ukraine ==\\nAfter the start of Russian invasion, US president Joe Biden has committed to aid Ukraine for \"as long as it takes\". However US strategy\\'s goals, aiding Ukraine and at the same time preventing Russian escalation, were contradicting each other. This contradiction \"produced a repetitive cycle of Ukraine pleading for systems Washington denied, allies (particularly the United Kingdom) moving forward without the United States, the Biden ad'),\n",
